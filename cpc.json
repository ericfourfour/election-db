Elected in October 2015, Michael serves as the Official Opposition Deputy Shadow Minister for Justice.  He also served as Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and Vice-Chair of the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying.\nEarly in his term, Michael was tasked by Conservative Interim Leader Rona Ambrose with leading the complex issue of physician-assisted dying within the Conservative MP caucus.  As Vice-Chair of the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying, Michael helped author a dissenting report to provide protections for vulnerable persons, improved palliative care, and conscience protections for medical practitioners.  Some of the recommendations in the Conservative dissenting report were adopted by the government in Bill C-14, the government\u2019s legislative response to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s Carter decision that struck down the blanket Criminal Code prohibition on physician-assisted dying.\nSince his election, Michael has been a strong advocate for victims and strengthening Canada\u2019s criminal justice system.  Michael sponsored Bill S-217, known as Wynn\u2019s Law, in honour of the late Constable David Wynn who was shot and killed by a career criminal who was out on bail, because his extensive criminal history was not disclosed at the bail hearing.  Wynn\u2019s Law would amend the Criminal Code to make it mandatory for the criminal history of bail applicants to be introduced at bail hearings to help prevent what happened to Constable Wynn.\nMichael has also worked closely with victims of impaired driving.  He has advocated for mandatory sentences for impaired driving offences, and vocally opposed efforts by the Liberal government to water-down sentences for impaired driving offences and other serious offences in the government\u2019s Bill C-75.\nMichael successfully passed his Private Members\u2019 Bill C-417 through all stages of the House of Commons with unanimous all-party support.  Bill C-417 seeks to amend the Criminal Code to carve out a narrow exception to the jury secrecy rule so that former jurors can disclose all aspects of their jury service with a mental health professional.  This legislation would protect the integrity of the jury secrecy rule while ensuring that former jurors who are suffering from mental health issues arising from their jury service can get the help they need and deserve.  Michael\u2019s Bill would implement a key recommendation of the unanimous report of the Justice Committee on Juror Supports.\nDuring his term Michael has had other legislative accomplishments.  He successfully passed Wynn\u2019s Law at second reading stage with the support of 27 Liberal MPs, despite opposition from the Liberal government.  He also urged the government to repeal zombie laws to prevent another injustice like the one experienced by the McCann family.\nMichael is a lifelong resident of St. Albert and an active community volunteer.  He is a Lector and Eucharistic Minister at St. Albert Catholic Parish and a member of the Knights of Columbus, St. Albert Rotary Club and the St. Albert and District Chamber of Commerce.\nA graduate of the University of Alberta, Michael received a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws, both with distinction.

The Vancouver native quickly fell in love with his adopted city and chose to set down roots.\nOver his 10 years and 160 games with the Ticats, Peter enjoyed career stability uncommon in professional sports. He took advantage of that stability to invest in Hamilton, building a successful small business, and started a family. Peter is married to Rachel and together they have two young daughters, Louise (2) and Helena (4 months). Peter also gave back to the community whenever the opportunity presented itself by volunteering with fundraisers and non-profit community initiatives, becoming a leader in the Tiger-Cats community outreach program. Hamilton had become his home.\nPeter is a 2nd generation Polish-Canadian, a hard worker, and a team player who has earned the respect of Hamilton fans and his fellow professional athletes. Over the course of his football career, he has earned many unique distinctions.\nPeter was the first ever Canadian football player to receive a full scholarship at Louisiana State University, where he won the NCAA National Championship under storied Coach Nick Saban. His subsequent career has taken him from White House receptions to sub-zero Grey Cups with starring roles on TV programs like CBC\u2019s Canada\u2019s Smartest Person and Jeopardy! along the way.\nDeveloping into one of the league\u2019s premier offensive guards, in 2011 he was the Tiger-Cats\u2019 nominee for the CFL\u2019s Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman Award and the following year Peter was named a CFL Eastern Division All Star. In back-to-back seasons in 2012 and 2013, Peter was voted by the league\u2019s defensive linemen and coaches to the CFLPA All Star Team.\nOver the course of his impressive 11 year CFL career, Peter has dedicated much of his time to his role on the CFL Players\u2019 Association. In his current position as CFLPA Treasurer, Peter is no stranger to collective bargaining, group benefits, and employee workplace and financial concerns. In his role with the players union he helps fellow players navigate employment issues and disputes. On more than a few occasions over his career, Peter put his job on the line to stand up for the rights of his teammates.\nWhile he played his 11th and final football season with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, there was never any doubt that Peter would be back. True to his heart, Peter came back and in November of 2018 signed his formal retirement papers with the Tiger-Cats, closing the book on a remarkable 180-game CFL career.\nNow he is embarking upon a new challenge with the goal of giving back to Hamilton, the city which has given him so much. From his football career, to his business, and his young family, Peter gives all the credit for his good fortune to the People and City of Hamilton. When he is elected, Peter will ensure that Canada\u2019s 9th-largest city is heard and respected on the national stage. Peter will also work within the Conservative Party in Canada\u2019s Parliament to bring good jobs and long term investments back to Hamilton. Hamilton families deserve to be able to see their kids stay in the city and find stable, rewarding careers here.","ed_code":35037.0},{"name":"Eric Duncan","nomination_dt":"21\/02\/2019","cabinet_position":null,"donate":"https:\/\/www.sdsgconservative.ca\/donate","website":"https:\/\/ericduncan.ca\/","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/EricDuncanSDSG\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricDuncanSDSG","instagram":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ericduncansdsg\/?ref=badge","photo":"https:\/\/cpcassets.conservative.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/03155138\/1f9d967f103e501.png","bio":"Eric Duncan has had a successful career in both the government and private sector at the age of 31.

He became involved in his community at an early age, working as a soccer coach in Quebec\u2019s AAA league before taking over the Victoriaville soccer tournament, which he helped grow into one of Quebec\u2019s top three tournaments.\nIn school, he earned a Bachelor of Education in mathematics and computers, followed by a Master of School Administration. He began his career as a teacher before moving into administrative positions, including as principal of Polyvalente Le Bois\u00e9 high school in Victoriaville. He first entered politics as a candidate for the Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec party, under the leadership of Mario Dumont, in 2003. Fuelled by his passion for politics and community service, he became mayor of Victoriaville in 2009. After six years at the city\u2019s helm, he made the leap into federal politics and, in October 2015, was elected as the member for Richmond-Arthabaska for the Conservative Party. Since then, he has taken on numerous roles in Parliament and, in June 2017, was named Quebec Political Lieutenant by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.\nMunicipal accomplishments\nDuring his two terms as mayor, Alain Rayes oversaw an unprecedented infrastructure renewal and enhancement effort. He accomplished this by bringing together key players across all sectors, including members of the business community, federal and provincial officials, as well as representatives of the Commission scolaire des Bois-Francs school board and the C\u00e9gep de Victoriaville college. He succeeded in gaining their support for several new infrastructure projects, giving the city a tremendous boost.\nConstruction projects included the new Le Carr\u00e9 150 cultural centre, \u00c9douard-Dubord pool, Yvon-Par\u00e9 stadium and Beaudet reservoir footbridge. The Terre-des-Jeunes park performance site, R\u00e9mi Deshaies baseball stadium, Sani-Marc sports complex and Promutuel multi-sports complex also underwent revitalization. Not only did these projects address the needs of residents, but they also gave Victoriaville an edge in its efforts to attract workers.\nA responsibly minded politician, Alain Rayes was careful not to neglect important municipal upgrades, making record investments in roads, the sewer and water system, and parks, all without raising the debt or municipal taxes.\nDuring his time as mayor, Alain Rayes\u2019 involvement was not limited to his own municipality. He was also active in Quebec\u2019s association of municipalities, the Union des municipalit\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec (UMQ), and it wasn\u2019t long before he became the organization\u2019s second vice-president and municipal agglomeration caucus chair. These roles attest to his desire to effect change at the national level.\nThrough this involvement, he was able to not only promote Victoriaville, but also directly contribute to the development of Quebec\u2019s municipalities.\nIt is no secret that Alain Rayes is very active on social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. His accessibility and relevance quickly made him a point person for the national media for comment on a variety of issues. His communications skills and expertise have helped him gain recognition throughout Quebec.\nHealthy lifestyle\nMeeting Pierre Lavoie in 2011 was a defining moment in the politician\u2019s life. He made the decision to change his life dramatically and committed to a healthy lifestyle. The positive effects of that decision soon followed. In 2012, he completed his first marathon and, in 2015, took part in his first Ironman competition, a race consisting of a 3.8 km swim, 180 km bike ride and 42.2 km run.\nIn 2015, La Presse gave him the title of Quebec\u2019s fittest mayor thanks to his ability to balance his busy schedule and a healthy lifestyle.\nLearning and advancement\nImmediately following his election as a member of Parliament, Alain Rayes began drawing notice for his drive and enthusiasm. He was soon given key responsibilities in the party, including as Assistant Critic for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. In the role, Alain Rayes was responsible for addressing the legalization of marijuana, giving several interviews and statements in the House on the subject. He also publicly addressed electoral reform, as an official party critic for the issue, alongside G\u00e9rard Deltell. In July 2016, the interim leader of the Conservative Party named him Assistant Critic for Foreign Affairs, and, in September, he took on the role of Associate Critic for Infrastructure, Communities and Urban Affairs. Within his first year as an MP, he had already become a member of the party\u2019s shadow cabinet.

As Official Opposition Critic for the Treasury Board, he is currently a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which investigates Auditor General\u2019s reports on government spending and the management of taxpayers\u2019 money.\nPrior to the last election, Poilievre served as Minister of Employment and Social Development\u2014the largest department in the federal government\u2014where he oversaw the successful rollout of the increased Universal Child Care Benefit. The department he led is also responsible for Old Age Security, housing, job training, Employment Insurance and poverty reduction.\nIn 2013, Poilievre became Minister of Democratic Reform responsible for drafting the Fair Elections Act and stickhandling it through Parliament. It cracked-down on the undue influence of money in politics, made it easier for people to vote and required they show identification before doing so.\nThat law built on his work as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury Board President, wherein he helped then-Minister John Baird pass the Federal Accountability Act through Parliament. Later, he served as the Prime Minister\u2019s Parliamentary Secretary (2008-2011), during which he co-authored the Conservative 2011 election platform, which helped the party win a majority government and led to spending reductions, tax cuts, and a balanced budget.\nCommunity\nPoilievre has become known for championing causes brought to him by constituents.\nMost recently, he worked with the Liberal government to help save the life a local small businessman. Colin Perera was in the late-stages of kidney failure when his nephew in Sri Lanka offered to come to Canada to provide an organ transplant. Immigration Canada denied his visitor visa. After Poilievre learned of the problem, he worked with the Immigration Minister, John McCallum, to secure a rare Ministerial permit so the nephew could enter Canada for the operation, which is expected in spring of 2016.\nSimilarly, a Canadian Armed Forces Major from Osgoode informed Poilievre that the government prevented him from spending time with his new baby, when it denied his parental leave under Employment Insurance. Major Jim Duquette\u2019s benefits had expired while he was on military deployment in the Middle East. According to the rules, prisoners could defer their benefits while in jail, but soldiers could not defer benefits during a mission. Poilievre convinced the government to introduce the Fairness for Military Families Act, which allows soldiers to defer their parental leave until after they return from military missions, giving them precious time off with their small children.\nIn 2005, an Osgoode farming family brought the idea of a Children\u2019s Fitness Tax Credit to Poilievre, who shared it with then-Opposition Leader, Stephen Harper. He campaigned on and implemented the tax credit in 2006. It allowed families to claim up to $1000 per child in sports registration costs.
